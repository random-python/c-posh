POSH
====

Python Object Sharing, or POSH for short, is an extension module to
Python that allows objects to be placed in shared memory.  Objects in
shared memory can be accessed transparently, and most types of
objects, including instances of user-defined classes, can be shared.
POSH allows concurrent processes to communicate simply by assigning
objects to shared container objects.  On multiprocessor architectures,
multi-process applications using POSH can significantly outperform
similar multi-threaded applications, since Python threads don't scale
to take advantage of multiple processors.  Even so, POSH lends itself
to a programming model very similar to threads.
